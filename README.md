# Hi everyone! This is my module 2 assignment. 

# I have everything in place but for some reason my section titles are underneath my paragraph elements. 
# It was working before I had the row width set up and then I placed that so the divs would take the entire width of the page.
# Once I fixed this issue, the titles went underneath. I don't know how to fix it.
# Please help if you can!

# Thank you!
